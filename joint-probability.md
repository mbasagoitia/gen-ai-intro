# Joint Probability for Generative Models

Lots of possibilities, but which one is the most probable?

**Joint probability** is the probability of a set of events occurring together. An **event** occurs when a slot is filled with an item in the vocabulary.

We can calculate the **probability distribution** with the data frequency. Probability = frequency / total

## Probability value vs probability distribution

Probability distribution (of all possibilities) is given by p(x1) = [0.58, 0.42] <- these values must add up to 1 to be a valid probability distribution

Probability value of x1 = meow = 0.58
or x1 = woof = 0.58
